# Grocery Store Backend - A Rest API
This project consists of a rest API that is designed to simluate the working of a grocery store. 
## Tech Stacks
1. Python 3.8- Programming language
2. Django 3.2 - Python based web framework
3. Django-REST Framework 3.12 - A powerful toolkit to create web APIs
## Assumptions
1. Every item present in the grocery store has a unique name, i.e., no two distinct items have the same name in the system. Hence, the item name is used as primary key in the items table.
2. Every user is identified by his/her phone number. This is a valid assumptions as this system is followed by major retail giants all over the world. Hence, the phone number is used as a primary key in the users table.
